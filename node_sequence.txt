ProgramDescription

This program, in the typical case, first constructs a sequence of linked nodes
containing integer values and displays the values in that sequence. Then the
program removes one of the values from the sequence and re-displays the revised
sequence to prove that the value has in fact been removed. Finally, the program
adds a new value to the sequence after a particular value in the sequence, and
once again displays the sequence values to show that the new value has in fact
been inserted. If the value to be removed is not actually in the sequence, then
the sequence is unchanged when re-displayed. Similarly, if the sequence value
after which a new value is to be added is not actually in the sequence, then in
this case too the sequence remains unchanged when redisplayed.

The program receives its input from the following six command-line arguments:
1. First is the (smaller) start value of the range of values for the sequence.
2. Second is the (larger) end value of the range of values for the sequence.
3. Third is either a 'b' or an 'e' to indicate whether each new values should
   be added to the beginning or to the end of the sequence as the sequence is
   being constructed.
4. Fourth is the value to be removed from the sequence (this value may or may
   not actually be in the sequence.
5. Fifth is the new value to be added to the sequence.
6. Sixth is the sequence value after which the new value is to be added (this
   value too may or may not actually be in the sequence).
                                                                  Screen 1 of 1
